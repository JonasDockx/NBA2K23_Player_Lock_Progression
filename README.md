# NBA2K23_Player_Lock_Progression
Player lock progression system for NBA 2K MyLeague

This is based on an idea by [u/rustyhwe](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/xl11pq/player_lock_progression_system "u/rustyhwe") on Reddit.<br />
Due to the MyCareer mode being so focussed on VC, an alternative way of playing the game is feels less like a grind.<br />
You can play MyLeague with Player lock, this achieves the same purpose as MyCareer, and you can upgrade attributes and badges based on how well you do in games.<br />
<br />
<H1>What does this do?</H1>
Multiple players can be tracked with this Python script. They get stored in a database<br /> 
To start, you either need to create a player or select an already created player.<br />
Once you've done this, you get three options.<br />
<br />
The first option is to input the game statistics. You will be able to enter the amount of points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals you recorded in a game.<br />
You can also tick the boxes for possible awards you've won.<br />
Depending on the statistics you input here, you will get development points and badge points to spend.<br />
These can be spend on the below two things.<br />
<br />
The second option you get is to upgrade your attributes.<br />
You get an overview of all your current attributes and you can choose which ones to upgrade with your development points.<br />
<br />
The final option is to upgrade your badges.<br />
Badges can be upgraded using either development points or badge points.<br />
<br />
<H1>What are the requirements?</H1>
<H2>Python</H2>
This is a Python script. As such, it will need Python to run.<br />
Installing Python is fairly easy:<br />
<br />
<br><strong>Download Python:</strong></br>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_new">official Python website</a>.</li>
<li>Click on the "Download Python" button. This will download the latest version of Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br><strong>Run the Installer:</strong></br>
<ul>
<li>Once the download is complete, open the installer.</li>
<li>Ensure that you check the box that says &ldquo;Add Python to PATH&rdquo; before clicking &ldquo;Install Now&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br><strong>Verify the Installation:</strong></br>
<ul>
<li>Open Command Prompt and type <code>python --version</code>.</li>
<li>If Python is successfully installed, you should see the version number.</li>
</li>
<H2>The Python Pillow library</H2>
This is a Python library that is necessary to run this script.<br />
It is very easy to install.<br />
You should open the Command Prompt first.<br />
In orde to do this, you can just click the Windows button on your keyboard.<br />
In the search bar, you can just type in CMD.<br />
You will find the Command Prompt that way.<br />
<br />
In the command prompt, you have to type in pip install Pillow.<br />
This is all that needs to be done.<br />
Once you've done this, you can just run the Python script by double-clicking it.<br />
This will start the player progress tracker.<br />
<br />
<H3>The Wembanyama icon (optional)</H3>
You can just place the Wembanyama.ico file in the same diectory as NBA2K23.py.<br />
