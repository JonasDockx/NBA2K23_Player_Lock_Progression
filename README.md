Player lock progression system for NBA 2K MyLeague

This is based on an idea by [u/rustyhwe](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/xl11pq/player_lock_progression_system "u/rustyhwe") on Reddit.<br />
Due to the MyCareer mode being so focussed on VC, an alternative way of playing the game is feels less like a grind.<br />
You can play MyLeague with Player lock, this achieves the same purpose as MyCareer, and you can upgrade attributes and badges based on how well you do in games.<br />
<br />
<H1>What does this do?</H1>
Multiple players can be tracked with this Python script. They get stored in a database<br /> 
To start, you either need to create a player or select an already created player.<br />
Once you've done this, you get three options.<br />
<br />
The first option is to input the game statistics. You will be able to enter the amount of points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals you recorded in a game.<br />
You can also tick the boxes for possible awards you've won.<br />
Depending on the statistics you input here, you will get development points and badge points to spend.<br />
These can be spend on the below two things.<br />
<br />
The second option you get is to upgrade your attributes.<br />
You get an overview of all your current attributes and you can choose which ones to upgrade with your development points.<br />
<br />
The final option is to upgrade your badges.<br />
Badges can be upgraded using either development points or badge points.<br />
<br />
<H1>What are the requirements?</H1>
<H2>Python</H2>
This is a Python script. As such, it will need Python to run.<br />
Installing Python is fairly easy:<br />
