Player lock progression system for NBA 2K MyLeague

This is based on an idea by [u/rustyhwe](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/xl11pq/player_lock_progression_system "u/rustyhwe") on Reddit.
Due to the MyCareer mode being so focussed on VC, an alternative way of playing the game is feels less like a grind.
You can play MyLeague with Player lock, this achieves the same purpose as MyCareer, and you can upgrade attributes and badges based on how well you do in games.

<H1>What does this do?</H1>
Multiple players can be tracked with this Python script. They get stored in a database.
To start, you either need to create a player or select an already created player.
Once you've done this, you get three options.

The first option is to input the game statistics. You will be able to enter the amount of points, rebounds, assists, blocks and steals you recorded in a game.
You can also tick the boxes for possible awards you've won.
Depending on the statistics you input here, you will get development points and badge points to spend.
These can be spend on the below two things.

The second option you get is to upgrade your attributes.
You get an overview of all your current attributes and you can choose which ones to upgrade with your development points.

The final option is to upgrade your badges.
Badges can be upgraded using either development points or badge points.
